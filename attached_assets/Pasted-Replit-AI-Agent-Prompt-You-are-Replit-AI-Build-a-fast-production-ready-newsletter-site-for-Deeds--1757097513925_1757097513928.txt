Replit AI Agent Prompt

You are Replit AI. Build a fast, production-ready newsletter site for Deeds Without Debt (DWD), focused on alternative real estate investing: tax deeds, tax liens, HOA foreclosures, probate, and other non-bank strategies.

Use Vite + React + TypeScript. No server backend beyond potential form proxy required. Prioritize performance (Lighthouse 95+), accessibility (WCAG AA), and clean, modern UI.
