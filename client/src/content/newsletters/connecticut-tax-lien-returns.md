# How I Earned 18% on a Connecticut Tax Lien (Redeemed in 6 Months)

## Tax Lien Investing in Connecticut: 18% Returns You Won't Find on Wall Street

Why everyday investors are turning to Connecticut's tax lien auctions for predictable double-digit returns and hidden real estate opportunities.

This week, I'm handing the mic to Tricia Jacobs, an experienced tax lien investor who's been working auctions across New England. She's seen firsthand how Connecticut's lien market offers double-digit returns most investors don't even know exist.

## Why CT Is Special

**High Redemption Rates (70–85%)** — Most owners pay back, meaning predictable income.

**Urban Opportunities** — In cities like Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, some owners don't redeem—opening the door to potential foreclosures.

**Eastern CT Advantage** — Lower property values, less competition, and smaller certificate sizes make it easier for smaller investors to participate.

It's a market with room for both conservative investors (just chasing the interest) and those hoping to eventually acquire property.

## How It Compares

| Investment Type | Typical Return | Risk / Effort Level | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Rental Property | 8–12% | High | Requires management, repairs, tenants |
| Stocks | ~10% | Medium/High | Market volatility and timing risk |
| Tax Liens (CT) | 18% | Low/Medium | Guaranteed by state statute; potential property acquisition |

It's not glamorous, but it's steady—and in a world of shaky markets, that consistency matters.

## My Advice If You're Starting

- Attend a few tax lien sales just to observe the process.
- Start small — $1,000 to $5,000 is plenty to learn the ropes.
- Learn one or two municipalities well (each runs auctions differently).
- Be patient — redemptions often take 12–24 months.

These small, consistent wins build confidence and capital.

## Why I Focus on Connecticut Liens

Most people chase the stock market or rental properties. But in Connecticut, tax liens consistently offer 18% annual returns, guaranteed by statute.

For context:

- **S&P 500 (10-yr avg):** ~10%
- **Treasury Bonds:** 4–5%
- **CT Tax Liens:** 18% if redeemed

There aren't many other legal, predictable ways to earn that kind of return without tenants or Wall Street volatility.

## How It Works

1. When property owners miss their tax bills, municipalities sell tax lien certificates to investors.
2. You step in and cover the unpaid taxes.
3. The owner now owes you the principal plus 18% interest.

Typical lien sizes in Eastern Connecticut range from $800 to $6,000.

- If the owner pays, you collect your interest.
- If they don't, you can foreclose and take title to the property.

It's a simple system — but like most good investments, it rewards the disciplined, informed investor.

## Final Thoughts

Tax lien investing in Connecticut isn't about luck — it's about predictability.

While others are watching the stock market swing, lien investors are collecting steady returns backed by real property.
