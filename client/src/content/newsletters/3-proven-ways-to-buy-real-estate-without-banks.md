# 3 Proven Ways to Buy Real Estate Without Banks: Tax Deeds, Tax Liens & HOA Foreclosures

**By Ralph T. Biah â€” Founder, Deeds Without Debt**

Learn how tax deeds, tax liens, and HOA foreclosures can open the door to real estate ownership without relying on traditional mortgages.

## 1. Tax Deeds

When property owners stop paying their property taxes, the county eventually seizes the property and auctions it off.

- You're bidding on the actual property, not just the debt.
- Some counties require full payment right away; others give you 24â€“72 hours.
- The catch? You often need to budget for title cleanup (like a quiet title action) before you can sell.

**Why it works:** If you do your homework, you can pick up houses and land for 20â€“40 cents on the dollar.

## 2. Tax Liens

Instead of selling the property, some states sell the tax debt itself. You pay the back taxes, and in return, you earn interest when the owner pays you back.

- If they don't, you can foreclose and take the property.
- Yields vary â€” some states pay 8%, 12%, even 18% interest.
- Redemption periods matter: some last months, others years.
- Not every lien leads to a property, but when it does, it can be a big win.

**Why it works:** You either make high interest on your money or position yourself to own the property down the road.

## 3. HOA Foreclosures

In many communities, owners must pay homeowners association (HOA) dues. If they fall behind, the HOA can foreclose â€” even if the mortgage is current.

- In super-lien states, HOA claims can actually jump ahead of the mortgage.
- You're usually bidding at much lower amounts â€” sometimes just the past-due dues plus legal fees.
- The risk? Mortgages and other liens can still survive the HOA sale. You need to know the hierarchy of liens in your state.

**Why it works:** Few investors pay attention to HOA sales, so competition is lower.

## Final Thoughts

These three methods â€” Tax Deeds, Tax Liens, and HOA Foreclosures â€” are powerful because they don't rely on banks, brokers, or traditional financing. They require research and discipline, but once you understand the process, the opportunities are endless.
