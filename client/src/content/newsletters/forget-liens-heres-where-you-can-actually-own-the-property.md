# The Truth About Tax Deed vs Tax Lien States

Most investors get this wrong from day one.

They hear about "guaranteed returns" from tax lien certificates and think they've found the holy grail of real estate investing.

**Here's the reality:** Tax lien investing is mostly a myth for most people.

### Key Advantages:

- **Immediate ownership** - You get the deed right after the auction

- **Clear title** - The tax sale extinguishes most other liens
- **Real property** - You own actual real estate, not just a piece of paper
