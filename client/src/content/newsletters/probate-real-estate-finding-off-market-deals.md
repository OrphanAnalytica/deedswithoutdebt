*How My Team, My Mentor, and I Found Big Wins in the New Mexico Desert.*

Every time a new sale pops up in Torrance County, I feel a pull back to where it all started for me. This is where I cut my teeth in tax deed investing—and let me tell you, this county has produced some of my best wins. Not just me either—my mentor, one of the sharpest investors I've ever learned from, has had major successes here. And over the years, members of my investment team have picked up properties in Torrance County that turned into amazing deals.

On September 25th at 10AM in Estancia, NM, the county will auction off a fresh batch of properties. For newcomers, this isn't just a sale—it's an education. You'll see the highs, the hidden gems, and (if you're not careful) the traps.

One more thing I love about Torrance County? Its proximity to Albuquerque. Being close to a growing metro means there's always a market for homes, land, and rentals. That's why I keep an eye on this sale every time it comes around.

Let me walk you through four properties on this list that really caught my eye.

## 91 Caballo Ave, Moriarty, NM 87035 – Item #14

* 2 acres with a single-family home
* **Opening Bid:** $8,500
* **Market Value:** ~$150,000

**Why I like it:** Homes on acreage at these opening bids are rare. If it's structurally sound, you could be looking at massive win.

## 58 Seville Ave, Moriarty, NM – Item #19

* Vacant double wide on 5 acres
* **Opening Bid:** $14,400
* **Market Value:** ~$182,000

**Why I like it:** Manufactured homes scare some investors away, but the land carries the value. With 5 acres, you've got flexibility—replacement, rental, or resale.

## 125 Charlie Breckenridge Ave, Moriarty, NM – Item #20

* Single-family home
* **Opening Bid:** $5,900
* **Market Value:** $200,000+

**Why I like it:** The low opening bid compared to market value makes this one stand out. If the title clears and the structure checks out, this could be a sleeper deal.

## 62 Sam Ford Dr, Estancia, NM 87016 – Item #49

* Single-family home on 5 acres
* **Opening Bid:** $16,200
* **Market Value:** ~$272,000

## Why Due Diligence Matters in New Mexico

This is where a lot of new investors slip up. In New Mexico:

* **Mortgages survive the sale.** If there's a recorded mortgage, it doesn't get wiped out—you take the property with that debt still attached.
* **IRS & State Tax Liens:** These can also survive, and you don't want to inherit those unknowingly.
* **Judgments & Mechanics Liens:** Depending on how they were recorded, these can stick as well.
* **Quit Claim Deed Only:** The state gives you no warranty of title. It's on you to clean up issues afterward.
* **Microfiche Records:** Many counties—including Torrance—still keep old-school archives. You (or someone you hire) may need to be there in person to review the chain of title.

**The bottom line:** the numbers may look exciting, but without thorough research, you could end up buying someone else's problems instead of a hidden gem.

## Final Word

If you're new, my advice is simple: pick one property, research it like your future depends on it, and watch how much you'll learn in the process.

That's how I started, and why Torrance County remains a place where my mentor, my team, and I continue to see real success.
