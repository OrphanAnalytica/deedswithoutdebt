A lot of people ask me: "How do I even start if I don't live in the county where the sale is happening?" Here's exactly how I'd explain it to a friend — step by step.

## Step 1: Start with the right state

Find out if it's a tax deed state (you're bidding on the property itself) or a lien state (you're bidding on the tax debt).

**Why it matters:** in deed states you're closer to ownership, but rules vary — some have redemption periods, some don't.

## Step 2: Narrow down to a county

Every county runs its sales differently. Some are online, some are at the courthouse. Some give you a clean spreadsheet, others upload a scanned PDF that looks like it was typed in 1987.

**Why it matters:** the county controls the list, the timing, and the rules.

## Step 3: Ask for the list

Call or email the Treasurer's/Tax Collector's office. It's as simple as:

*"Hi, I'm interested in your upcoming tax deed sale. Could you send me the sale list and bidder instructions?"*

They'll usually email it to you or point you to the county's website or auction portal.

## Step 4: Check the property values

With the list in hand, your next stop is the Assessor's Office. Plug in the parcel numbers and pull the assessed values, year built, square footage, and land details.

**Why it's important:** assessed value ≠ market value, but it gives you a quick baseline. From there, check market comps online (Zillow, Redfin, local MLS if you can).

## Step 5: Dig into the records

Now comes the part that separates serious bidders from casual ones. Head over (virtually, if possible) to the County Clerk/Recorder and search:

* Mortgages or deeds of trust
* HOA or municipal liens
* IRS tax liens (often supersede the sale and do not get wiped out)
* State tax liens (many also survive the sale)
* Mechanic's liens (contractor claims for unpaid work — can cloud title)
* Probate filings
* Judgments or lawsuits
* REC (real estate contracts)

This tells you if you're buying a clean property or stepping into someone else's mess.

## Step 6: Check the courts

Look at the county court system (and federal PACER) for:

* Bankruptcies (these can pause or block sales)
* Active lawsuits (foreclosure, code enforcement, quiet title issues)
* Probate cases tied to the property

## Step 7: Put eyes on the property

If you're not local, don't worry — tech helps.

* Use Google Maps, Street View, and Earth
* Check roof, access, terrain, neighborhood
* Confirm parcel shape and access on the county GIS map
* Hire a local runner or agent for drive-by photos if it's serious

## Bonus Tip: Title Companies

If you're new or nervous about digging through liens yourself, you can hire a local title company to do the research for you.

Most charge around $100 per property to pull a lien search. That can get pricey if you're reviewing hundreds of parcels, which is exactly why I recommend learning how to do it yourself.

Once you get comfortable reading mortgages, liens, and probates, you'll save thousands — and move much faster than waiting on a third party.

## Takeaway

Getting the list is only the first step — the real advantage comes from doing the homework most bidders skip. By the time auction day rolls around, you'll know which properties are worth fighting for and which ones to cross off fast.

We'll save the bidding process for the next issue.
