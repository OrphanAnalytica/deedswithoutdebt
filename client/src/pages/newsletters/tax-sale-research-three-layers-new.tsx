      <p className="text-lg text-editorial-text font-medium mb-6">
        Here's the thing no one tells you about tax deed and tax lien investing: Most people don't lose money at the auction.
        They lose it three weeks earlier—at their kitchen table—when they convince themselves that a $80,000 assessed property with a $3,200 opening bid is "probably fine."
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        I've done it. You do the math — "$3,200 in, sell for $100K, I'm a genius." Then two months later, you're staring at a demolition order from 2019, a federal tax lien you didn't catch, and a landlocked parcel with no legal access.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The problem isn't the math. It's the research. Or rather, the lack of it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        After 12 years of buying properties through tax sales, I've learned that successful investing comes down to mastering three distinct layers of due diligence. Skip any one of them, and you're not investing—you're gambling.
      </p>

      <h2>The Three Layers Framework</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Think of tax sale research like peeling an onion. Each layer reveals more about what you're actually buying, and each layer has its own set of red flags to watch for.
      </p>

      <h3>Layer 1: Tax History</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This is where most investors start and stop. They check the current tax amount, maybe look at a few years of history, and call it good. But tax history tells a story—and that story can save you thousands.
      </p>

      <ProTip>
        Look for patterns in the tax history. Properties with consistently high taxes relative to their assessed value often indicate structural issues, environmental problems, or zoning complications that will affect your ability to resell.
      </ProTip>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Here's what I check in the tax history:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Are taxes paid regularly, or are there gaps that suggest financial distress?</li>
        <li><strong>Trends:</strong> Are taxes increasing faster than the local average? This could indicate special assessments or infrastructure improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparisons:</strong> How do the taxes compare to similar properties in the area?</li>
        <li><strong>Special assessments:</strong> Are there any pending or recent special assessments for infrastructure, utilities, or environmental remediation?</li>
      </ul>

      <ExampleBox>
        I once passed on a property in Florida where the taxes had jumped from $2,400 to $8,100 in two years. Turned out there was a $45,000 special assessment for stormwater management that wasn't visible in the basic tax records. The previous owner had stopped paying because they couldn't afford it—and neither could I.
      </ExampleBox>

      <h3>Layer 2: Title Clarity</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This is where things get interesting. The tax sale process doesn't guarantee you'll get clear title—it just gives you the right to pursue it. Title issues can turn a $5,000 investment into a $25,000 legal nightmare.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Key title checks include:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li><strong>Liens and encumbrances:</strong> Federal tax liens, HOA liens, mechanics liens, and other encumbrances</li>
        <li><strong>Easements:</strong> Utility easements, access easements, and conservation easements</li>
        <li><strong>Ownership history:</strong> Multiple owners, probate issues, or corporate ownership complications</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary disputes:</strong> Survey issues, encroachments, or disputed property lines</li>
      </ul>

      <WarningBox>
        Federal tax liens are particularly dangerous because they survive the tax sale process. If the IRS has a lien on the property, you'll need to satisfy it before you can get clear title—and that can cost more than the property is worth.
      </WarningBox>

      <h3>Layer 3: Property Reality</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This is the layer most investors skip entirely. They assume that if the taxes are reasonable and the title looks clean, the property must be fine. But the property itself can have issues that make it unsellable or unlivable.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Physical property checks include:
      </p>

      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li><strong>Structural condition:</strong> Foundation issues, roof problems, or major structural damage</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental concerns:</strong> Mold, asbestos, lead paint, or soil contamination</li>
        <li><strong>Utility access:</strong> Water, sewer, electricity, and gas connections</li>
        <li><strong>Zoning compliance:</strong> Legal use, setbacks, and development restrictions</li>
        <li><strong>Access issues:</strong> Road access, easement problems, or landlocked parcels</li>
      </ul>

      <ProTip>
        Drive by the property if possible. Look for signs of abandonment, structural damage, or environmental issues. Check if utilities are connected and if there's legal access to the property. These visual cues can save you from expensive mistakes.
      </ProTip>

      <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The three layers work together to give you a complete picture of what you're buying. Skip any one of them, and you're operating with incomplete information.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Here's my process for every property I consider:
      </p>

      <ol className="mb-6">
        <li><strong>Start with tax history:</strong> Look for red flags in the payment patterns and tax amounts</li>
        <li><strong>Move to title research:</strong> Check for liens, encumbrances, and ownership issues</li>
        <li><strong>End with property reality:</strong> Verify the physical condition and legal compliance</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-reference everything:</strong> Make sure the story each layer tells is consistent</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If any layer reveals significant issues, I pass. There are always more properties, but there's only so much money to lose on bad deals.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Tax sale investing isn't about finding the cheapest properties—it's about finding the right properties. The three layers framework helps you identify properties that are genuinely undervalued rather than just cheap for a reason.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Master these three layers, and you'll avoid the expensive mistakes that wipe out most new investors. Skip them, and you'll learn the hard way why experienced investors spend more time researching than bidding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The goal isn't to find perfect properties—it's to find properties where the issues are manageable and the upside is real. The three layers framework helps you make that distinction before you write the check.
