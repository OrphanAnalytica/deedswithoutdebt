# Hawaii Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (tax deeds with 1-year redemption period)
- Frequency: County-specific schedules (varies by county)
- Format: Public auction conducted by individual counties
- Redemption: 1 year from sale date (12% annual interest)
- Payment: Full payment typically due at time of sale

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes delinquent** for 3+ years on property taxes
2. **County publishes legal notice** minimum 4 weeks before sale
3. **Public auction conducted** at county-designated location
4. **Winning bidder receives tax deed** immediately
5. **Owner has 1-year redemption period** at 12% annual interest
6. **Deed must be recorded within 60 days** or redemption period extends

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **County tax office records**: Research delinquency history and assessment data
- **Hawaii Revised Statutes §231-67**: Understand tax deed law and redemption rules
- **Title search**: Check for liens, easements, and ownership issues
- **Zoning verification**: Confirm permitted uses and development restrictions
- **Environmental assessment**: Check for contamination, tsunami zones, lava zones
- **Access verification**: Ensure legal access to property (critical in rural areas)

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $5,000-$50,000+ (varies significantly by location and property type)
- **What beginners miss**: 1-year redemption risk; title insurance challenges; remote property access
- **Exit paths**: 12% interest if redeemed; property ownership if not redeemed; resale opportunities
- **Island premium**: Limited land supply drives high property values and competition
