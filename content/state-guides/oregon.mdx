# Oregon Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (counties foreclose and take ownership, then sell)
- Frequency: County-specific schedules (varies throughout year)
- Format: County-managed auctions after 2-year redemption period
- Redemption: 2 years from judgment date (9% annual interest)
- Payment: Minimum 20% deposit at sale, balance due within 30-60 days

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes 3 years delinquent** (May 16th deadline)
2. **County creates foreclosure list** within 2 months
3. **Court judgment issued** after legal proceedings
4. **Property "sold" to county** immediately
5. **2-year redemption period** begins from judgment date
6. **County auction** held after redemption period expires
7. **Deed issued** to winning bidder

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 312**: Review foreclosure and redemption laws
- **County foreclosure lists**: Research properties entering redemption period
- **Title search**: Check liens, encumbrances, and ownership history
- **Property inspection**: Physical condition and access assessment
- **Redemption status**: Confirm redemption period has expired
- **Market analysis**: Comparable sales and development potential

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $5,000-$100,000+ (varies by county and property type)
- **What beginners miss**: 2-year redemption wait; limited inventory; competitive Portland market
- **Exit paths**: Rental income; development opportunities; resale in strong Oregon markets
- **Oregon advantage**: Strong real estate appreciation; outdoor recreation economy; urban growth

## How Oregon's County-Based System Works

### Foreclosure and Judgment Process
**Timeline and Requirements:**
- **May 16**: Annual property tax delinquency date
- **3 years later**: Property becomes subject to foreclosure (e.g., 2021 taxes → eligible 2024)
- **Within 2 months**: County tax collector prepares foreclosure list
- **Court proceedings**: 30+ days of publication and hearings
- **Judgment issued**: Property legally "sold" to county

**Legal Framework (ORS Chapter 312):**
- **ORS 312.120**: 2-year redemption period requirements
- **ORS 312.122**: Reduced redemption for waste/abandonment
- **ORS 312.200**: Final deed transfer to county after redemption expires

### 2-Year Redemption Period
**Who Can Redeem:**
- Property owners with recorded legal interest at judgment date
- Heirs or devisees of legal interest holders
- Recorded lienholders (mortgage companies, lenders)

**Redemption Costs (Must Pay in Full):**
- All delinquent taxes shown in judgment
- 5% penalty on delinquent amount
- **9% annual interest** calculated daily from judgment date
- **Redemption fee**: $50 (first year) OR actual title search cost (second year)
- **No partial payments accepted**

**Reduced Redemption Period:**
Counties can reduce to **30 days** if property:
- Is subjected to waste or forfeiture
- Is unoccupied for 6+ consecutive months by owner/lienholders
- Suffers substantial depreciation

### County Auction Process (After Redemption Expires)
**Sale Authority:**
- Counties decide whether to keep, transfer, or sell at public auction
- Properties added to county surplus property inventory
- Sold "as-is" with no warranties or title insurance

**Typical Auction Procedures:**
- **Registration**: Limited participation (often 100 bidders maximum)
- **Deposit**: 20% cash or cashier's check required at sale
- **Balance due**: Within 30-60 days of sale
- **Minimum bid**: Often 70% of assessed Real Market Value
