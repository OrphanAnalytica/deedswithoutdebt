# Ohio Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Hybrid** (34 counties tax lien certificates, 54 counties tax deed sales)
- Frequency: County-specific schedules (varies throughout year)
- Format: Bulk tax lien portfolio sales OR Sheriff's deed auctions
- Redemption: 3-year contract for liens; varies for deeds
- Payment: Certified funds required; high capital requirements

## How the Sales Work

### Tax Lien Certificate Counties (34 counties)
1. **County creates portfolio** of delinquent tax certificates
2. **Bulk sale conducted** (portfolios worth $10-17 million)
3. **Winning bidder purchases entire portfolio** (no individual certificates)
4. **3-year contract period** to collect taxes + up to 18% interest
5. **Foreclosure rights** if not redeemed after contract period

### Tax Deed Counties (54 counties)
1. **Property becomes 3+ years delinquent** on taxes
2. **County files foreclosure action**
3. **Sheriff's sale conducted** (typically first Tuesday monthly)
4. **Public auction** with competitive bidding
5. **Sheriff's deed issued** to winning bidder after confirmation

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Ohio Revised Code 5721.30-5721.43**: Review tax sale legal framework
- **County determination**: Verify if county does liens or deeds
- **Portfolio analysis**: For lien counties, analyze entire portfolio composition
- **Property inspection**: Physical site visits for deed sale properties
- **Title search**: Check liens, mortgages, and encumbrances
- **Market analysis**: Property values, rental rates, development potential

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $10-17 million (lien portfolios) / $5,000-50,000+ (deed properties)
- **What beginners miss**: Bulk-only lien sales; high capital requirements; Sheriff's deed limitations
- **Exit paths**: Interest collection on liens; property ownership through deeds; foreclosure rights
- **Ohio advantage**: High interest rates (up to 18%); large metropolitan areas
