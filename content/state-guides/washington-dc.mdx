# Washington DC Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Lien** (tax lien certificates with potential to ripen into title)
- Frequency: Annual auction (July) plus year-round over-the-counter sales
- Format: In-person auction at designated locations plus online OTC purchases
- Redemption: Owner may redeem until certificate ripens to title (varies)
- Payment: 20% minimum deposit required before bidding; balance due immediately

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes delinquent** on real property taxes or BID assessments
2. **DC Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR)** publishes annual tax sale list
3. **Annual auction** held in July with daily sessions (8:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
4. **Winning bidders receive tax lien certificate** for delinquent amount
5. **Over-the-counter sales** available year-round for unsold properties
6. **Certificate may ripen to title** if property not redeemed within specified period

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **OTR website research**: Check mytax.dc.gov for property details and sale lists
- **Certificate of Clean Hands**: Required for all purchasers (no DC tax delinquencies)
- **Property inspection**: Physical site visit recommended before bidding
- **Title research**: Check for federal liens, mortgages, and other encumbrances
- **Zoning verification**: Confirm permitted uses and development restrictions
- **Environmental concerns**: Research potential contamination, especially commercial properties

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $500-$15,000 for most certificates (varies widely by property value)
- **What beginners miss**: Clean Hands requirement; additional liens not reflected in bid amount
- **Exit paths**: Redemption income; potential title acquisition; assignment/sale of certificates
- **DC-specific advantage**: High property values and gentrification create strong investment potential
