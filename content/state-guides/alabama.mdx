# Alabama Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Lien** (tax lien certificate purchases)
- Frequency: Annual (county-run; dates vary by county)
- Format: In-person or online depending on county

## How the Sales Work
1) **Where to find the list**: County tax collector/revenue commissioner posts legal notice and sale list
2) **Who runs the sale**: County tax collector/revenue commissioner (probate involvement varies)
3) **Key deadlines / redemption rules**: Owner can redeem within 3 years; state-bid parcels can be redeemed until title leaves the state. Typical interest 8–12% depending on county/statute and sale type
4) **Payment rules**: Certified funds/cashier's check; immediate or same-day payment required

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Assessor lookup**: County assessor/GIS lookup by parcel number for property details
- **Title/Liens considerations**: Federal/EPA liens can survive tax lien sales; research senior liens
- **Code/Flood/Access checks**: Verify legal access, floodplain status, utilities; check probate/estate status
- **Occupancy and possession notes**: Tax liens don't provide immediate possession; redemption period applies

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $500-$8,000 for certificates, varies significantly by county and property value
- **What beginners miss**: Understanding state-bid vs. third-party purchase differences; redemption likelihood analysis
- **Exit paths**: Redemption income play (8-12% interest over 3 years); deed acquisition for non-redeemed properties

## Contacts
- **County Tax Collectors**: Each county handles sales independently
- **County Revenue Commissioners**: Tax records and sale procedures (varies by county structure)

## How Alabama's System Works

### The Tax Lien Certificate Process
1. **Property becomes delinquent** on taxes (varies by county timeline)
2. **County advertises tax sale** in local newspaper and posts legal notices
3. **Annual tax sale** held at courthouse or designated location
4. **Winning bidder receives tax lien certificate** for delinquent amount
5. **Property owner has 3 years** to redeem by paying taxes plus interest
6. **If not redeemed,** lienholder may pursue deed/foreclosure per county procedure

### Unique Advantages
- **Secured by real estate** unlike unsecured investments
- **Government-backed process** with statutory interest rates
- **Multiple exit strategies** through redemption income or property acquisition
- **Annual opportunities** in each of Alabama's 67 counties

## State-Bid vs. Third-Party Sales

**State-Bid Properties:**
- Properties that didn't sell at initial auction
- State takes lien for tax amount
- Can be redeemed until title leaves state possession
- Different redemption timeline than third-party purchases

**Third-Party Purchases:**
- Investor purchases lien at auction
- 3-year redemption period from sale date
- Interest accrues during redemption period
- More predictable timeline for investors

### Property Acquisition Strategy
Target properties for potential ownership:

### Geographic Diversification
