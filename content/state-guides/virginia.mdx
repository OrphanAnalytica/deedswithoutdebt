# Virginia Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (counties sell property title, not tax lien certificates)
- Frequency: County-specific schedules (varies throughout year)
- Format: Judicial sales at courthouse or designated locations
- Redemption: Until close of business day before sale (no post-sale redemption)
- Payment: Cashier's check or certified check required

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes delinquent** for 3+ years on real property taxes
2. **County files suit** seeking judicial sale of property
3. **Court approval obtained** for sale procedures and terms
4. **30+ day advance notice** published in newspapers and posted
5. **Public auction conducted** at courthouse or designated location
6. **Special warranty deed issued** to winning bidder
7. **No redemption period** after sale completion

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Virginia Code Section 58.1-3965**: Review judicial sale requirements and procedures
- **County tax records**: Research delinquency history and assessment data
- **Court filings**: Check for pending litigation and sale approval status
- **Title search**: Identify liens, mortgages, and encumbrances
- **Property inspection**: Physical site visit for condition and access
- **Zoning verification**: Confirm permitted uses and development potential

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $5,000-$50,000+ (varies significantly by location and property type)
- **What beginners miss**: No post-sale redemption; special warranty deed limitations; court approval requirements
- **Exit paths**: Immediate ownership upon sale; rental income; development opportunities; resale
- **Virginia advantage**: No redemption period provides immediate clear ownership
