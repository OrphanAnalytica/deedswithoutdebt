# Colorado Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Hybrid** (treasurer's deed with redemption rights)
- Frequency: Annual county sales (timing varies)
- Format: Public auction at county courthouse

## How the Sales Work
1) **Where to find the list**: County treasurer publishes list in newspaper and online
2) **Who runs the sale**: County treasurer at courthouse or designated location
3) **Key deadlines / redemption rules**: 3-year redemption period for most properties; 9 years for agricultural/residential homestead
4) **Payment rules**: Full payment due day of sale; cashier's check or certified funds

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Assessor lookup**: County assessor websites for property details and GIS mapping
- **Title/Liens considerations**: Federal liens survive; research senior liens and HOA dues
- **Code/Flood/Access checks**: Verify water rights, access roads, mining claims, altitude considerations
- **Occupancy and possession notes**: Immediate ownership but lengthy redemption period risk

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $2,000-$20,000+ depending on county and property type
- **What beginners miss**: Water rights complexity, mining claims, altitude/access issues
- **Exit paths**: 9% annual redemption interest; property ownership if not redeemed

## Contacts
- **County Treasurers**: Each county conducts independent sales
- **County Assessors**: Property information and valuation

## How Colorado's System Works

### The Treasurer's Deed Process
1. **Property becomes delinquent** on taxes (usually after 3+ years)
2. **County treasurer advertises sale** in local newspaper for 5 weeks
3. **Public auction** held at courthouse steps or designated location
4. **Winning bidder receives treasurer's deed** immediately
5. **Former owner has redemption period** (3 years general, 9 years agricultural/homestead)
6. **Redemption payment**: Original bid plus 9% annual interest

### Unique Advantages
- **Immediate ownership** unlike tax lien certificates
- **9% guaranteed return** if property redeems (higher than many states)
- **Full ownership** if property doesn't redeem after redemption period
- **Mountain and recreational properties** often available

## Colorado's Redemption System

### Redemption Periods
**3-Year Redemption:**
- Commercial properties
- Vacant land (non-agricultural)
- Investment properties
- Most improved properties

**9-Year Redemption:**

- Owner-occupied residential

### Redemption Payment
- **Principal**: Original winning bid amount

## Colorado-Specific Considerations

### Water Rights Complexity
Colorado's prior appropriation water system:
- **Senior Water Rights**: May be separate from land
- **Well Permits**: Required for most water use
- **Ditch Rights**: Irrigation water delivery systems
- **Due Diligence**: Research water court records

### Mining Claims and Mineral Rights
- **Active Claims**: May affect surface use
- **Mineral Severance**: Surface vs. subsurface rights
- **BLM Records**: Federal mining claim research
- **Environmental Issues**: Historic mining impacts

### High Altitude Considerations
- **Access Issues**: Snow, seasonal road closures
- **Building Challenges**: Short construction seasons
- **Utilities**: Limited availability in remote areas
- **Market Seasonality**: Recreation property demands

### Recreational Property Market
- **Ski Areas**: High-value resort communities
- **Hunting/Fishing**: Recreational access value
- **Vacation Rentals**: Short-term rental potential
- **Land Banking**: Long-term appreciation plays

## Investment Strategies

### 9% Income Strategy
Focus on properties likely to redeem:
- **Agricultural Properties**: 9-year redemption period
- **Homestead Properties**: Owner-occupied residences
- **Improved Properties**: Higher redemption likelihood
- **Conservative Bidding**: Ensure value supports bid

### Property Acquisition Focus
Target properties for ownership:
- **Vacant Land**: Lower redemption rates
- **Recreational Properties**: Out-of-state owners
- **Distressed Properties**: Financial hardship cases
- **Investment Properties**: Non-homestead properties

### Geographic Specialization
- **Front Range**: Suburban growth opportunities
- **Mountain Counties**: Recreational property focus
- **Eastern Plains**: Agricultural land banking
- **Western Slope**: Energy sector opportunities

## Due Diligence Process

### Pre-Auction Research (45+ Days)
**Legal Requirements:**
- Properties advertised 5 consecutive weeks
- Minimum bid equals taxes, interest, and costs
- Legal descriptions published with tax amounts

**Research Steps:**
1. **Property Inspection**: Physical site visit when possible
2. **Title Research**: County records and title company search
3. **Water Rights**: State engineer office and water court records
4. **Mining Claims**: BLM and county mining records
5. **Market Analysis**: Recent sales and comparable properties

### Environmental and Access Issues
- **Flood Zones**: FEMA mapping and flood history
- **Wetlands**: Corps of Engineers jurisdiction
- **Access Roads**: Year-round vs. seasonal access
- **Utilities**: Availability and connection costs

## Common Pitfalls

### Water Rights Oversights
- **Assumption Errors**: Land doesn't automatically include water
- **Due Diligence**: Research state engineer records
- **Well Permits**: Verify existing permits and capacity
- **Court Decrees**: Understand adjudicated water rights

### Redemption Risk Management
- **Long Periods**: 3-9 year redemption periods
- **Interest Rates**: 9% may not keep pace with inflation
- **Opportunity Cost**: Capital tied up for extended periods
- **Market Changes**: Property values may fluctuate

### Mountain Property Challenges
- **Access Issues**: Seasonal road closures
