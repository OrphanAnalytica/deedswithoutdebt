# Georgia Tax Deed Investment Guide

*Last updated: November 5, 2024*

Georgia operates a unique "redeemable tax deed" system that combines elements of both tax deed and tax lien investing. The famous First Tuesday auctions provide monthly opportunities, while the redemption period adds a layer of complexity that can work in investors' favor.

## System Overview

**Type:** Hybrid (Redeemable Tax Deed)  
**Redemption Period:** 1 year from date of sale  
**Auction Format:** Live courthouse steps auctions  
**Frequency:** First Tuesday of every month  
**Interest Rate:** 20% per annum if redeemed  
**Competition Level:** Moderate (varies by county)  
**Average ROI:** 180-250%

## How Georgia's System Works

### The Redeemable Tax Deed Process
1. **Property becomes delinquent** on taxes (varies by county)
2. **County advertises property** for tax sale (4 weeks in newspaper)
3. **First Tuesday auction** held at courthouse steps
4. **Winning bidder receives tax deed** immediately
5. **Former owner has 1 year** to redeem by paying purchase price + 20%
6. **After 1 year,** deed becomes absolute and non-redeemable

### Unique Advantages
- **Immediate ownership** unlike tax lien certificates
- **20% guaranteed return** if property redeems
- **Full ownership** if property doesn't redeem
- **Monthly opportunities** at every courthouse

## The First Tuesday Tradition

### Statewide Consistency
Every county in Georgia holds tax deed auctions on the first Tuesday of each month at 10:00 AM at the courthouse steps (weather permitting).

### Auction Format
- **Live bidding** in person at courthouse
- **Cash or certified funds** required for payment
- **Immediate payment** typically required
- **Sheriff's deed** issued to winning bidder

### COVID-19 Adaptations
Many counties now offer:
- **Online bidding options**
- **Hybrid live/online auctions** 
- **Extended payment terms** (24-48 hours)
- **Electronic deed delivery**

- No additional costs or fees charged to investor
- Payment typically within 30 days of redemption

**Redemption Likelihood Factors:**

- **Season:** More redemptions in spring/summer

### Right of Redemption Strategies
**For Redemption-Focused Investors:**
- Target properties likely to redeem for guaranteed 20% return
- Focus on homesteads and improved properties
- Shorter holding periods (average 6-8 months)
- Lower risk, predictable returns

**For Property Acquisition Investors:**
- Target properties unlikely to redeem
- Focus on vacant land, distressed properties
- Longer potential holding periods
- Higher risk, higher potential returns

### Timber and Rural Land Opportunities
Georgia's extensive forests create unique opportunities:
- **Timberland:** Properties with harvestable timber
- **Hunting Leases:** Recreational income potential
- **Conservation Programs:** CRP and similar programs
- **Development Potential:** Future subdivision or commercial use

## Investment Strategies

### The 20% CD Strategy
Treat tax deed purchases like 20% CDs:
