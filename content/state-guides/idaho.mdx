# Idaho Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (counties take title, then auction properties)
- Frequency: Annual auctions (spring/summer timing varies by county)
- Format: County-run auctions (online and in-person formats)
- Redemption: 14-month period from tax deed issuance (before auction)
- Payment: Cash or certified funds due at sale

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes 3+ years delinquent** on property taxes
2. **County issues tax deed** to itself (takes ownership)
3. **Certified notices mailed** 2-5 months before hearing
4. **Tax deed hearing** held by county commissioners
5. **14-month marketing period** follows (properties can be redeemed)
6. **Public auction conducted** within 14 months of hearing
7. **County conveys quit claim deed** to winning bidder

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **County tax records**: Research delinquency history and assessment data
- **Idaho Code Title 63, Chapter 10**: Review tax deed statutes and procedures
- **Title search**: Check liens, mortgages, and ownership history
- **Property inspection**: Physical site visit for condition and access
- **Zoning verification**: Confirm permitted uses and development potential
- **Utility availability**: Check water, sewer, power, and road access

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $1,000-$25,000 (varies by location and property size)
- **What beginners miss**: 14-month redemption risk; quit claim deed limitations; title insurance delays
- **Exit paths**: Rental income; resale after seasoning; development opportunities
- **Idaho advantage**: Growing population, outdoor recreation economy, relatively affordable entry

## How Idaho's County-Based System Works

### The Tax Deed Process (Idaho Code ยง63-1005)
**Year 1-3: Delinquency Period**
- Property taxes become delinquent December 20 (or following Monday)
- Interest accrues at 1% per month on delinquent amounts
- Counties may accept partial payments but process continues
- Property cannot be redeemed with partial payments

**Year 4: County Takes Title**
- January 1: Counties begin tax deed process for 3+ year delinquent properties
- County takes title to property via tax deed to itself
- Process removes most liens except specific exceptions

**Pre-Hearing Phase (February-March)**
- 2-5 months advance notice required by certified mail
- Notices sent to record owners and parties of interest
- Property research and title examination conducted
- Public notice published in local newspapers

### County Tax Deed Hearings (Spring)
**Hearing Process:**
- County commissioners conduct formal hearings
- Property owners may present objections or redemption
- Most hearings result in tax deed confirmation
- Process creates clear county ownership

**Post-Hearing Redemption (14-month period):**
- Only record owners or parties with legal interest can redeem
- Must pay full delinquency plus current taxes, penalties, interest, and costs
- Redemption period ends when county enters sale contract
- Counties actively market properties during this period

### Public Auctions (Within 14 months)
**Sale Requirements:**
- Must be conducted within 14 months of hearing
- Public auction format (online or in-person by county)
- Minimum bid includes taxes, penalties, interest, and costs
- Cash or certified funds required

**Title Conveyance:**
- Counties convey quit claim deed (not warranty deed)
- Most prior liens removed except mortgages where notice was insufficient
- New owner receives title free from most encumbrances
- Properties generally not eligible for title insurance for 1-3 years

## Due Diligence Process

### Pre-Auction Research (120+ Days)
**Legal Requirements:**
- Counties must provide certified notice 2-5 months before hearing
- Tax deed hearing creates official county ownership
- 14-month auction deadline after hearing

**Essential Research Steps:**
1. **Tax History Analysis**: Research delinquency timeline and amounts owed

3. **Physical Inspection**: Visit property for condition, access, and improvements
4. **Market Research**: Analyze comparable sales and rental rates
5. **Regulatory Review**: Zoning, building permits, environmental restrictions

### Idaho-Specific Considerations
**Water Rights Research:**
- Critical for agricultural and some residential properties
- Complex area of law requiring professional evaluation
- Rights may be separate from land ownership
- Irrigation district assessments may exist

**Access Verification:**
- Many rural properties accessed by easements
- Private road maintenance responsibilities
- Year-round vs. seasonal access
- Snow removal and maintenance costs

**Utility Availability:**
- Rural properties may lack utilities
- Well and septic system requirements
- Power line extension costs
- Internet and cellular service availability

## Common Pitfalls
