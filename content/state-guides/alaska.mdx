# Alaska Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (immediate ownership transfer, no redemption period)
- Frequency: Every ~2 years (borough dependent)
- Format: Sealed bid (varies by borough)

## How the Sales Work
1) **Where to find the list**: Each of Alaska's 19 organized boroughs publishes their own tax sale lists. Fairbanks North Star Borough has upcoming sealed-bid sales on **September 10, 2025**.
2) **Who runs the sale**: Borough clerk or treasurer (varies by borough)
3) **Key deadlines / redemption rules**: No redemption period - deed transfer is immediate and final
4) **Payment rules**: Typically cashier's check or wire transfer, payment due within 24-48 hours of award

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Assessor lookup**: Contact borough assessor for GIS maps and parcel details
- **Title/Liens considerations**: Tax deeds provide clear title; federal liens may survive
- **Code/Flood/Access checks**: Verify winterization requirements, access roads (many require plane/boat access)
- **Occupancy and possession notes**: Remote properties often vacant; check for wildlife intrusion

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $1,000-$15,000 for rural parcels, higher near population centers
- **What beginners miss**: Underestimating access costs and winterization requirements
- **Exit paths**: Recreational sales to out-of-state buyers, subdivision potential near towns

## Contacts
- **Fairbanks North Star Borough**: Borough Clerk - call for September 10, 2025 sealed-bid details
- **General guidance**: Call the borough clerk/treasurer for current tax sale information
