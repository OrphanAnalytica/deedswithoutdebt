# Connecticut Tax Sales Guide

## Overview

- Format: Municipal auctions (in-person or online)

## How the Sales Work
1) **Where to find the list**: Municipal tax collector offices publish delinquent lists
2) **Who runs the sale**: Municipal tax collector for each city/town
3) **Key deadlines / redemption rules**: 2-year redemption period; 18% annual interest rate
4) **Payment rules**: Full payment typically due same day; certified funds required

## Due Diligence Checklist

- **Municipal Assessors**: Property information and valuation data

## How Connecticut's System Works

### The Tax Lien Certificate Process
1. **Property becomes delinquent** on municipal taxes
2. **Municipality advertises tax sale** per state statutes
3. **Annual tax sale** conducted by tax collector
4. **Winning bidder receives tax lien certificate** for full delinquent amount
5. **Property owner has 2 years** to redeem by paying taxes plus 18% interest
6. **If not redeemed,** lienholder may foreclose on the property

### Unique Advantages
- **High interest rate** at 18% annually (among highest in nation)
- **Stable market** with high property values
- **Limited geographic area** allows deep market knowledge
- **Wealthy demographics** generally lead to high redemption rates

## Connecticut's Municipal System

### Municipal Independence
Connecticut has 169 municipalities, each conducting independent tax sales:
- **Varied Schedules**: Sales typically in fall/winter but dates vary
- **Different Procedures**: Each municipality sets own sale rules
- **Competition Levels**: Vary significantly by municipality wealth
- **Property Types**: From urban to rural to coastal properties

### 18% Interest Structure
- **Statutory Rate**: Fixed at 18% annually
- **Simple Interest**: Calculated from purchase date
- **No Bidding Down**: Interest rate is fixed, not subject to competitive bidding
- **Compound Potential**: Interest compounds if not paid annually

## Connecticut-Specific Considerations

### Coastal Property Regulations

### Historic Districts and Preservation
- **Local Historic Districts**: Development restrictions
- **State Historic Preservation**: Additional regulatory layers
- **Tax Credits**: Potential historic tax credit opportunities
- **Renovation Costs**: Higher costs due to historic requirements

### High Property Values Impact
- **Large Certificate Amounts**: Require significant capital
- **High Redemption Rates**: Wealthy property owners typically redeem
- **Competition**: Institutional investors drawn to high-dollar certificates
- **Market Stability**: Less volatility but also less opportunity

## Investment Strategies

### 18% Income Focus
Target certificates likely to redeem for guaranteed high returns:
- **Wealthy Municipalities**: Greenwich, Westport, New Canaan
- **Primary Residences**: Owner-occupied properties
- **Reasonable Tax Amounts**: Affordable for property owners
- **Conservative Approach**: Focus on interest income over property acquisition

### Urban Opportunity Strategy
Focus on urban areas with lower redemption rates:
- **Hartford**: Urban properties with development potential

- **Bridgeport**: Industrial and residential opportunities
- **Waterbury**: Affordable properties with upside potential

### Rural/Vacation Property Focus
- **Litchfield County**: Rural and vacation properties
- **Eastern Connecticut**: Lower competition areas

## Due Diligence Process
