# Vermont Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (municipalities sell property to recover delinquent taxes)
- Frequency: Municipal sales (timing varies by town)
- Format: Public auction at designated locations
- Redemption: 1 year from sale date (1% monthly interest)
- Payment: Certified check, treasurer check, or money order only

## How the Sales Work
1. **Property becomes delinquent** for more than one year on property taxes
2. **Municipality offers repayment plan** (mandatory under Act 106)
3. **30-day certified notice** sent to owner and lien holders
4. **Public auction conducted** by municipal officials
5. **Winning bidder pays minimum bid** (taxes + fees + potentially utilities)
6. **Owner has 1-year redemption period** at 1% monthly interest
7. **Town attorney schedules closing** if not redeemed

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Municipal tax records**: Research delinquency history and payment status
- **Vermont Statutes Title 32, Chapter 133**: Review tax deed law and Act 106 changes
- **Title search**: Check liens, mortgages, and ownership complications
- **Property inspection**: Physical site visit for condition and access
- **Zoning verification**: Confirm permitted uses through municipal planning office
- **Utility status**: Check for delinquent water/sewer charges included in minimum bid

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $2,000-$15,000 (varies by property value and municipal practices)
- **What beginners miss**: Act 106 repayment plan requirements; 1-year redemption risk; title insurance challenges
- **Exit paths**: 12% annual interest if redeemed; property ownership if not redeemed; assignment opportunities
- **Vermont advantage**: Strong property rights protection but limited competition in rural areas

## How Vermont's Municipal System Works

### Act 106 Tax Sale Reforms (2024)
**New Legal Requirements:**
- **Extended delinquency period**: Must be delinquent more than one year (increased from shorter periods)
- **Mandatory repayment plans**: Towns must offer written repayment plans before tax sale
- **Enhanced notice requirements**: 30-day certified mail plus door posting if mail bounces
- **Plain language explanations**: Notices must be in multiple languages where applicable
- **Consultation requirement**: Must attempt to consult with taxpayer about circumstances

**Repayment Plan Process:**
1. Town must offer reasonable written repayment plan
2. Must consider factors that led to delinquency (hardship, income changes)
3. Can only proceed to tax sale if taxpayer:
   - Denies the plan
   - Fails to respond within 30 days
   - Fails to make agreed payments

### Pre-Sale Notice Requirements
**Certified Mail Notice (30 days minimum):**
- Sent to property owner at last known address
- Sent to all mortgage holders and lien holders of record
- Must include plain language explanation of process and rights

**Alternative Notice Methods:**
- If certified mail bounces back, must affix notice to front door
- Public posting required in town
- Newspaper publication (3 weeks successively, last publication 10+ days before sale)

**Notice Content Requirements:**
- Amount of delinquent taxes and fees
- Sale date, time, and location
- Property description and address
- Redemption rights explanation
- Repayment plan availability

### Municipal Auction Process
**Sale Authority:**

- **Interest rate**: 1% per month on winning bid amount
- **Who can redeem**: Property owner or lien holders with legal interest
- **Payment required**: Full winning bid amount plus accrued interest

**Pre-Expiration Notice (90-120 days):**
- Town must send certified notice before redemption period expires
- Final opportunity for owner to redeem before losing property permanently

**Final Transfer Process:**
- If not redeemed within one year, town attorney schedules closing
- Buyer pays current year taxes, water/sewer charges, transfer taxes
- Recording fees at purchaser's expense
- Any excess proceeds above taxes/fees go to former owner
