# New Mexico Tax Sales Guide

## Overview

New Mexico conducts tax sales through the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department Property Tax Division (PTD) to recover delinquent property taxes. These are public auctions where properties with unpaid taxes are sold to the highest bidder, providing opportunities for real estate investors while helping counties collect overdue tax revenue.

**Key Point:** New Mexico does NOT conduct tax lien sales or tax certificate sales - only direct property sales.

## How Tax Sales Work in New Mexico

### Tax Sale Process Timeline

- **Property Tax Due Dates:** November 10th and April 10th annually
- **Delinquency Period:** After 3 years from first delinquent date shown on tax delinquency list
- **Sale Window:** Property may be sold anytime after 3 years but must be offered within 4 years
- **Annual Requirement:** State must conduct at least one sale per year in each county with delinquent properties (effective 2014)

### Property Tax Lien Priority

- **Lien Creation:** Property tax liens arise on January 1st of the tax year for which taxes are imposed
- **Lien Priority:** Property tax liens have priority over most other liens
- **Lien Effect:** Tax sale extinguishes the tax lien only - other liens may remain

## Who Can Participate

### Eligible Bidders

- Any individual or entity
- Representatives with notarized authorization
- Community Land Grant-Merced trustees (with special matching rights)

### Restrictions

- State/county employees cannot purchase unless they were the original owner when taxes became delinquent
- Violation is a fourth-degree felony with fines up to $5,000 and 1-5 years imprisonment

## Sale Notice Requirements

### Property Owner Notice

- Certified mail to owner's last known address with return receipt
- Must include amount owed, sale date/time/location, and installment agreement options
- Failure to mail notice or receive return receipt can invalidate the sale

### Lien Holder Notice

- Notice must also be sent to recorded lien holders if addresses are reasonably ascertainable

### Public Notice

- Published in local newspaper once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks before sale
- If no local newspaper, published in nearby county newspaper
- May also publish in newspapers with broader circulation

## Bidding and Sale Procedures

### Registration

- Required on day of sale (typically 2 hours before auction starts)
- Registration closes promptly when sale begins
- Must provide full name, mailing address, and phone number
- Agents must present notarized authorization

### Bidding Process

- Oral bidding only
- Bidders must be physically present or represented by agent
- Property goes to highest bidder above minimum bid
- Auctioneer's decision on disputes is final

### Minimum Bid

- Cannot be less than total of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and costs
- State considers property owner's interest value but no specific amount required

## Payment Requirements

### Accepted Payment Methods

- Cashier's check
- Money order
- Personal or business check with bank letter of credit guaranteeing payment
- **NOT ACCEPTED:** Cash

### Payment Timeline

- Full payment required before conclusion of auction
- Successful bidders are responsible for all collection costs if payment fails

## What Buyers Receive

### Tax Deed

- Conveys all former owner's interest as of the date tax lien arose (January 1st of tax year)
- Subject only to "perfected interests" existing before tax lien date
- No warranty of title - property sold "as is"
- Deed equivalent to quitclaim deed

### Title Considerations

- State provides no title insurance or warranty
- Buyer receives whatever interest the former owner had
- Other liens may remain on property
- Buyer responsible for title research before sale

## Redemption Rights

### No Traditional Redemption Period

- New Mexico has NO post-sale redemption period for former owners
- Only exception: 120-day federal IRS redemption period if federal tax lien exists

### Challenge Period

- Former owners have 2 years from sale date to challenge conveyance in court
- Limited grounds for challenge:
  - Property not subject to taxation for the tax years in question
  - Required notice not properly mailed or return receipt not received
  - Owner had already paid all delinquent amounts before sale
  - Valid installment agreement existed but sale proceeded anyway

## Risks and Considerations

### Title Risks

- No guarantee of clear title
- May inherit existing liens, easements, or encumbrances
- Environmental liabilities pass to buyer
- Occupancy issues may exist

### Due Diligence Requirements

- **Property inspection:** Must stay outside boundaries (no trespassing)
- **Title research:** Buyer's responsibility - state provides no assistance
- **Lien search:** Check for mortgages, judgments, other encumbrances
- **Environmental assessment:** Consider potential contamination issues

### Property Condition

- Sold strictly "as is" with no warranties
- No refunds available
- All sales are final
- May have deferred maintenance issues

## Investment Strategies

### Research Phase

- Review upcoming auction listings on state website
- Conduct thorough title search at county clerk's office
- Research property values through county assessor
- Physically inspect properties (from public areas only)
- Calculate total investment including back taxes and potential improvement costs

### Bidding Strategy

- Set maximum bid based on research and stick to it
- Factor in all costs: back taxes, penalties, interest, sale costs
- Consider potential title issues and resolution costs
- Account for property condition and needed repairs

### Post-Purchase Actions

- Obtain title insurance if possible
- Consider quiet title action to clear any cloud on title
- Address any occupancy issues legally
- Plan for property improvements or resale

## Key Advantages

### Low Competition
Remote locations and limited marketing mean fewer bidders at most county auctions.

### Subdivision Potential
Relaxed subdivision regulations in many counties allow for profitable lot splits and development.

### No Redemption Period
Most tax deed sales in New Mexico provide immediate, clear title with no redemption rights.

## Strategy Notes

- **What beginners miss:** Water rights complexity, subdivision regulations
- **Exit paths:** Subdivision development, recreational sales, land banking
- **Not beginner-friendly:** Requires substantial due diligence and legal understanding
