# New Mexico Tax Sales Guide

## Overview
- System: **Deed** (no redemption period for most properties)
- Frequency: Varies by county (annual to bi-annual)
- Format: County-specific (live, sealed bid, or online)

## How the Sales Work
1) **Where to find the list**: Each county treasurer publishes tax sale lists separately
2) **Who runs the sale**: County treasurer or designated official
3) **Key deadlines / redemption rules**: No redemption period for most properties
4) **Payment rules**: Varies by county - typically cashier's check, some allow wire transfer

## Due Diligence Checklist
- **Assessor lookup**: County assessor GIS systems for parcel information
- **Title/Liens considerations**: Research State Engineer Office for water rights
- **Code/Flood/Access checks**: Verify subdivision allowability, access roads, water sources
- **Occupancy and possession notes**: Many properties are vacant land with subdivision potential

## Strategy Notes
- **Typical entry prices**: $1,000-$15,000 for large rural parcels
- **What beginners miss**: Water rights complexity, subdivision regulations
- **Exit paths**: Subdivision development, recreational sales, land banking

## Contacts
- **County Treasurers**: Contact individual counties for auction schedules
- **State Engineer Office**: Water rights research and transfers

## Key Advantages

### Large Parcel Opportunities
New Mexico commonly offers multi-acre parcels at tax deed auctions, creating subdivision and development potential.

### Low Competition
Remote locations and limited marketing mean fewer bidders at most county auctions.

Relaxed subdivision regulations in many counties allow for profitable lot splits and development.

### No Redemption Period
Most tax deed sales in New Mexico provide immediate, clear title with no redemption rights.

**Due Diligence Requirements**

## Investment Strategies
