# Catron County Win: $17K to $120K in 18 Months

*March 1, 2024 • 7 min read*

This is the deal that changed everything for me. A $17,000 tax deed purchase in remote New Mexico that I turned into $120,000 through strategic subdivision. Here's exactly how it happened, including the mistakes I made and lessons learned.

## The Discovery

I found this property while researching upcoming tax deed auctions in New Mexico. Catron County caught my attention because:

- Sparsely populated (only 3,500 residents in the entire county)
- Large properties often available
- Minimal bidding competition
- No online auction system (in-person only)

The property: **5 acres with a 1,200 sq ft cabin in Reserve, NM**

## Pre-Auction Research

**Step 1: Property records review**
- Purchased GIS maps showing exact boundaries
- Verified legal description matched tax records  
- Confirmed no active liens beyond property taxes
- Previous owner had paid $45,000 in 2018

**Step 2: Physical inspection** 
- Drove 6 hours from Albuquerque to inspect in person
- Cabin was weathered but structurally sound
- Well water and septic system functional
- Stunning mountain views on 3 sides

**Step 3: Market analysis**
- Similar cabins selling for $80,000-$120,000
- Raw land averaging $8,000-$12,000 per acre
- Key insight: No subdivided lots available in area

**Step 4: Subdivision feasibility**
- Called county planning department
- Confirmed subdivision allowed with proper surveys
- Minimum lot size: 1 acre
- No major utility or road requirements

## Auction Day

**Date:** September 15, 2022  
**Location:** Catron County Courthouse, Reserve, NM  
**Competition:** Only 4 other bidders present

**The bidding:**
- Opened at $8,500 (unpaid taxes plus fees)
- Two other bidders dropped out at $12,000
- Final bidding between me and local rancher
- Won at $17,000

**Immediate costs:**
- Winning bid: $17,000
- Deed recording: $125
- Wire transfer fees: $45
- **Total acquisition cost: $17,170**

## The 18-Month Journey

### Months 1-3: Legal and Survey Work
- Hired local surveyor: $3,200
- Attorney for subdivision application: $1,800
- County application fees: $750
- **Total professional fees: $5,750**

**Lesson learned:** Don't cheap out on the survey. My first surveyor made errors that delayed approval by 2 months.

### Months 4-9: Subdivision Approval Process
The county planning process took longer than expected due to:
- Environmental impact assessment required
- Road easement documentation
- Septic system compliance verification
- Water rights confirmation

**Additional costs during approval:**
- Environmental consultant: $2,100
- Road easement legal work: $900
- Water rights documentation: $650
- **Total regulatory costs: $3,650**

### Months 10-12: Property Improvements
While waiting for final subdivision approval, I invested in basic improvements:
- Cabin roof repair: $4,200
- Interior deep cleaning and minor repairs: $1,800
- Driveway grading and gravel: $2,200
- **Total improvement costs: $8,200**

### Months 13-18: Marketing and Sales

**The subdivision result:** 2 parcels
- Parcel A: 1 acre with cabin and well
- Parcel B: 4 acres of raw land with mountain views

**Marketing strategy:**
- Listed cabin parcel with local realtor (6% commission)
- Sold raw land myself through Craigslist and Facebook
- Targeted out-of-state buyers looking for recreation property

**Sale #1 - The Cabin (Month 15)**
- Listed at $89,000
- Sold for $75,000 after 3 months on market

- Closing costs: $1,200
- **Net proceeds: $69,300**

**Sale #2 - Raw Land (Month 18)**

## What Went Right

**Thorough due diligence:** The subdivision research was key to identifying the value-add opportunity.

**Patient capital:** Having 18 months of carrying costs budgeted allowed me to wait for proper subdivision approval.

**Local relationships:** Building rapport with county staff and local contractors was essential.

**Market timing:** Recreational property demand was strong during COVID remote work trend.

## What Went Wrong (And Cost Me)

**Survey delays:** Using a cheap surveyor initially cost me 2 months and $1,500 in rework.

**Permitting timeline:** I underestimated regulatory approval time by 4 months.

**Improvement overruns:** Cabin repairs cost 40% more than budgeted due to remote location.

**Holding costs:** Property taxes, insurance, and security checks added up over 18 months.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Factor in ALL costs upfront** - My initial $25K budget became $37K reality
2. **Subdivision isn't always profitable** - Run numbers on worst-case scenarios  
3. **Local expertise is worth paying for** - Don't try to manage remotely
4. **Have patient capital** - This deal took 3x longer than planned
5. **Market timing matters** - I got lucky with recreational property demand

## Could This Be Replicated Today?

**Yes, but with modifications:**

- Higher property prices mean larger initial investments
- Interest rate environment affects buyer financing
- Increased competition in some tax deed markets
- Rising construction/improvement costs

**Similar opportunities exist in:**
- Rural Texas counties
- Northern Arizona  
- Parts of Nevada and Colorado
- Montana and Idaho

## Action Items for Newsletter Readers

1. **Research subdivision laws** in your target counties
2. **Build relationships** with local surveyors and attorneys before you need them
3. **Factor in 50% cost overruns** on initial estimates
4. **Have 12-24 months** of holding costs readily available

This deal proved that tax deed investing can generate life-changing returns, but it requires thorough preparation, adequate capital, and patience. The properties are out there – you just need to know how to find them and what to do once you own them.
