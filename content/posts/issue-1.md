# 3 Ways to Buy Real Estate Without Banks (And Why They Work)

*Issue #1 • March 15, 2024 • 5 min read*

After 8 years of acquiring properties without traditional bank financing, I've learned that the best real estate deals happen outside the conventional lending system. While most investors are fighting over the same MLS listings and competing with cash buyers backed by institutional money, there's an entire world of opportunities that require no credit checks, no debt-to-income ratios, and no bank approvals.

Here are the three strategies that have generated the highest returns in my portfolio:

## 1. Tax Deed Auctions: The Government's Fire Sale

**How it works:** When property owners fail to pay taxes for a specified period (usually 2-3 years), the county can sell the property at public auction to recover the tax debt.

**Why it's profitable:** You're buying at a fraction of market value because:
- Limited advertising means fewer bidders
- Cash-only requirement eliminates most competition  
- Properties sell for unpaid taxes plus fees, not market value

**Real example:** Last year in Catron County, NM, I purchased a 5-acre property with a cabin for $17,000. After subdividing, I sold the cabin on 1 acre for $75,000 and the remaining 4 acres for $45,000. Total return: $103,000 profit in 18 months.

**Best states:** Georgia, Texas, New Mexico, Alaska
**Typical investment:** $5,000 - $50,000
**Average ROI:** 150% - 400%

## 2. Probate Direct Marketing: Helping Families in Transition

**How it works:** When someone dies owning real estate, their heirs often need to sell quickly to settle the estate or divide assets. These sales happen off-market, creating opportunities for win-win transactions.

**Why it's profitable:**
- No competition from retail buyers
- Motivated sellers who need certainty and speed
- Properties often need work, creating additional value-add opportunities

**The approach:** Monitor probate filings, send empathetic direct mail to heirs offering fair cash purchases. Focus on helping families through a difficult time, not just getting deals.

**Real example:** Contacted heirs of a Phoenix property listed in probate court. Family needed to sell within 60 days to avoid losing the property to liens. Purchased for $145,000, invested $25,000 in repairs, sold for $220,000. Profit: $50,000, and the family avoided foreclosure.

**Best markets:** Major metro areas with active probate courts
**Typical investment:** $50,000 - $200,000  
**Average ROI:** 25% - 50%

## 3. HOA Foreclosure Opportunities: The Hidden Market

**How it works:** Homeowners associations can foreclose on properties for unpaid dues, special assessments, or violations. These foreclosures often have shorter timelines and less competition than bank foreclosures.

**Why most investors miss this:**
- HOA foreclosures aren't widely advertised
- Process varies significantly by state
- Many investors don't understand HOA lien priority

**The opportunity:** In many states, HOA liens can take priority over mortgages for certain amounts, creating situations where you can acquire properties subject to existing financing.

**Due diligence required:** 
- Understand your state's HOA lien laws
- Verify the validity of the HOA's claim
- Calculate total costs including any senior liens

**Best states:** Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Texas
**Typical investment:** $10,000 - $75,000
**Average ROI:** 100% - 300%

## Why These Strategies Work (When Banks Don't)

**Speed advantage:** While traditional financing takes 30-45 days, these deals close in 1-2 weeks with cash.

**Less competition:** Requiring cash upfront eliminates 90% of potential buyers.

**Information asymmetry:** Most investors don't know these opportunities exist or how to find them.

**Motivated sellers:** Whether it's the government collecting taxes or families settling estates, sellers have compelling reasons to transact quickly.

## Getting Started: Your 30-Day Action Plan

**Week 1:** Research your state's tax deed laws and upcoming auction dates
**Week 2:** Attend a local tax deed auction as an observer (don't bid yet)
**Week 3:** Visit your county probate court and review recent filings
**Week 4:** Choose one strategy and commit to your first deal analysis

## Important Disclaimers

These strategies involve risk and require significant due diligence. Always:
- Verify clear title before purchasing
- Understand redemption rights and timelines  
- Budget for unexpected repairs and holding costs
- Consult local attorneys familiar with these transaction types
- Never invest money you can't afford to lose
