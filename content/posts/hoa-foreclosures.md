# HOA Foreclosures: The Hidden Opportunity in Every City

*February 22, 2024 • 5 min read*

While most real estate investors are focused on tax deed auctions that happen once or twice a year, there's a year-round opportunity happening in practically every city in America that most people completely ignore: HOA foreclosures.

Homeowners associations can and do foreclose on properties for unpaid dues, special assessments, and even covenant violations. These foreclosures often fly under the radar, have less competition than traditional foreclosures, and can result in incredible deals for informed investors.

## How HOA Foreclosures Work

**The basics:** When homeowners don't pay HOA dues or special assessments, the association can place a lien on the property. If the debt remains unpaid, they can foreclose – just like a bank.

**Key differences from bank foreclosures:**
- Faster timeline (90-120 days vs 6-12 months)
- Less competition at auction
- Often not listed on traditional foreclosure websites
- Smaller debt amounts create bigger equity opportunities

**HOA lien priority varies by state:**
- **Super-priority states:** HOA liens take priority over mortgages for certain amounts
- **Standard priority:** HOA liens are subordinate to first mortgages
- **Mixed priority:** Different rules for different types of assessments

## Why This Opportunity Exists

**Most investors don't know about it:** HOA foreclosures aren't widely advertised or tracked by popular foreclosure websites.

**Attorneys don't specialize:** Many foreclosure attorneys focus on bank foreclosures and don't understand HOA law.

**Complex legal landscape:** State laws vary significantly, creating confusion about lien priority and foreclosure rights.

**Small debt amounts:** A $5,000 HOA debt on a $200,000 house isn't worth pursuing for many investors.

## Real Examples from My Portfolio

### Phoenix Townhouse (2023)
**The situation:** HOA had $12,000 lien for unpaid dues and special assessment for roof repairs. Property worth $180,000.

**The process:**
- Attended HOA foreclosure auction at law firm office
- Only 3 bidders present
- Won with bid of $15,000 (debt plus costs)
- Property had $145,000 first mortgage

**The outcome:**
- Purchased subject to existing mortgage
- Rented property for $1,400/month
- Monthly mortgage payment: $890
- Net cash flow: $510/month after expenses
- Tenant eventually bought the property for $185,000

### Las Vegas Condo (2022)  
**The situation:** $8,500 HOA lien on $150,000 condo. Nevada super-priority state.

**The key insight:** Nevada allows HOA liens to take priority over first mortgages up to 9 months of dues plus costs.

**The result:**
- Purchased for $9,200 at auction
- First mortgage was wiped out (Nevada law)
- Owned $150,000 condo free and clear
- Sold 6 months later for $148,000

## State-by-State Opportunity Analysis

### Super-Priority States (Best Opportunities)
**Nevada:** Up to 9 months priority over mortgages
**Florida:** Up to 12 months or 1% of mortgage balance
**Colorado:** Up to 6 months common assessments

### Standard Priority States (Good for Subject-To Deals)
**Arizona, Texas, California:** HOA liens subordinate but still create opportunities

### Limited Opportunity States
**Georgia, North Carolina:** Restrictive laws limit HOA foreclosure power

## Finding HOA Foreclosure Opportunities

### Direct HOA Contact
- Call management companies of large HOAs
- Ask about properties in foreclosure process
- Request notice of upcoming auctions

### Legal Notice Monitoring
- Check local newspapers for foreclosure notices
- Look specifically for "HOA" or "Association" foreclosures
- Set up Google alerts for "homeowners association foreclosure [your city]"

### Courthouse Research
- Monitor foreclosure filings for HOA plaintiffs
- Track specific law firms that handle HOA foreclosures
- Attend foreclosure auctions even when bank properties are scheduled

## Due Diligence Essentials

**Title research is critical:**
- Determine exact lien priority
- Calculate total debt including interest and fees
- Verify mortgage balances and payment status

**HOA compliance check:**
- Review CC&Rs and bylaws
- Understand ongoing assessment obligations  
- Check for pending special assessments

**Property condition assessment:**
- Many HOA foreclosures result from financial distress
- Budget for deferred maintenance
- Verify all utilities are functional

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Misunderstanding lien priority:** This varies significantly by state and can make or break a deal.

**Ignoring ongoing obligations:** You inherit all HOA obligations when you purchase.

**Underestimating legal costs:** HOA law can be complex and require specialized attorneys.

**Overlooking special assessments:** Large pending assessments can destroy your ROI.

## Getting Started: 30-Day Action Plan

**Week 1:** Research your state's HOA foreclosure laws and lien priority rules

**Week 2:** Identify 10 large HOAs in your target area and contact their management companies

**Week 3:** Start monitoring legal notices and set up Google alerts

**Week 4:** Attend a local foreclosure auction to understand the process

## Tools and Resources

**Legal research:** Check your state's HOA statutes (usually in state code Title 47 or similar)

**Property research:** Use county records to identify HOA-managed communities

**Market analysis:** Focus on areas with high HOA dues and older communities

## Is This Strategy Right for You?

**Best for investors who:**
- Understand subject-to transactions
- Have good legal support
- Can handle complex title issues
- Want year-round deal flow

**Not recommended for:**
- Beginning investors
- Those without legal expertise access  
- Investors focused only on free-and-clear properties

## The Bottom Line

HOA foreclosures represent one of the most overlooked opportunities in real estate investing. While others are fighting over the same tax deed auctions twice a year, these opportunities happen continuously in every major metropolitan area.

The key is understanding your state's laws, building relationships with HOA management companies, and having the legal expertise to navigate complex lien priority issues.

Done correctly, HOA foreclosures can provide steady deal flow with less competition and faster timelines than traditional foreclosure investing.
