|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 001 | $50,000 | $75,000 | 70% | $35,000 | $5,000 | $40,000 |
| 002 | $75,000 | $100,000 | 67% | $50,000 | $7,500 | $57,500 |

### ROI Analysis Formulas

#### Basic ROI Calculation
ROI = (Market Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100

#### Example: Property 001
ROI = ($75,000 - $40,000) / $40,000 × 100 = 87.5%

#### Cash Flow Analysis
Monthly Cash Flow = (Rental Income - Expenses) - (Total Cost / 12)

#### Break-Even Analysis
Break-Even Months = Total Cost / Monthly Cash Flow
