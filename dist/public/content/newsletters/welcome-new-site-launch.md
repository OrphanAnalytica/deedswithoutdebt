Hey there,

Big news â€” our brand-new site DeedsWithoutDebt.com is officially live.

Feels really good to say that. It's been a grind: late nights, broken links, too much coffee, and more "why is this 404ing again?" moments than I care to admit. But we made it.

This isn't just a facelift. It's the foundation for everything we're building in the tax sale space â€” real education, real opportunities, real community.

## What We're Building (and Why)

We want Deeds Without Debt to be the go-to spot for serious investors â€” not the "get rich quick" crowd, but the folks who actually want to understand how this game works.

Here's what's waiting for you on the new site ðŸ‘‡

**State-by-State Guides** â€” No legal jargon. Just plain-English breakdowns of how each state runs its tax lien and deed sales. (If you've ever wanted to understand how a Kansas tax deed auction can turn a $3,000 bid into a property worth $100K â€” we've got you covered.)

**Free Resources** â€” Checklists, research templates, and due diligence worksheets you can actually use.

**Auction Database** â€” Upcoming tax sales from across the country, updated regularly. No paywall. No nonsense.

Take five minutes this week, click around, and see what we've built. You'll know right away this site's built by investors, not marketers.

## New Newsletter Schedule Starts Next Week

Starting next week, here's how your inbox will look:

ðŸ“˜ **Monday: Educational Deep Dives** â€” strategy, due diligence, and lessons learned the hard way. Think: how to vet a property before bidding or how to spot red flags before they cost you thousands.

ðŸ“… **Wednesday: Auction Alerts & Market Opportunities** â€” which counties are opening soon, which ones are under the radar, and where investors are quietly cashing in.

ðŸ’¬ **Friday: Real Stories & Q&A** â€” real-life wins, near misses, and community insights. Like the investor who earned 18% in six months in Connecticut â€” and the one who bought a swamp (and somehow made it profitable).

## A Quick Favor

Take a look at the new site this week and tell me what you think.

What's missing? What would make it unmissable?

Your feedback's what makes this community different â€” grounded, experienced, and actually helpful.

See you Monday,
