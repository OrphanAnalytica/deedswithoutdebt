*On August 27, 2025, both Chatham County and Chowan County held their tax deed sales. But here's the thing most newcomers don't realize: winning at the courthouse auction is just the beginning.*

## What Is an "Upset Bid"?

In North Carolina, every tax sale property enters a **10-day upset bid period** after the courthouse auction.

* Anyone can walk into the Clerk of Court's office and place a new bid.
* Each upset must be at least **5% higher** than the current bid OR **$750 more** (whichever is greater).
* Every new upset bid resets the 10-day countdown.
* The process ends only when 10 full days pass with no new bids.

That means a property could stay in upset-bid limbo for weeks or even months.

## Why This Matters to Investors

For professional investors, this system is actually an advantage:

* **No courthouse pressure** — they can skip the live sale.
* **Built-in time for deeper due diligence** during each 10-day period.
* **Strategic timing** — file an upset bid close to the deadline, leaving less time for competitors to respond.
* **Real competition happens after the auction**, not during it.

## Key Takeaway

In North Carolina, the courthouse steps don't crown the winner. The Clerk of Court's office does.

Both Chatham and Chowan counties are perfect examples: the sales ended on August 27th, but the properties above are still very much in play.

If you're watching North Carolina tax sales, don't stop at the courthouse. The smart money is made by tracking — and strategically filing — upset bids.
