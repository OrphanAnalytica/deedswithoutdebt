*National headlines make bold claims, but local governments still rely on property taxes — and that keeps tax deed and lien sales alive for investors like you.*

On July 4, 2025, President Trump mentioned the idea of eliminating property taxes. It caught headlines everywhere, and for a moment you might have thought: what would that mean for me as an investor?

Here's the truth: property taxes aren't going anywhere. They're the backbone of county revenue, and without them, schools, police, and fire departments couldn't function.

So, what's the real takeaway for you as a tax deed or lien investor? Let me walk you through why property taxes will remain, and why that creates steady opportunity if you know where to look.

## 1. Property Taxes Are Decided Locally

Property taxes are controlled by counties and municipalities, not the federal government. That means Washington doesn't dictate whether your local county holds a tax sale. For you, this is important: no matter what's said on a national stage, those courthouse auctions on the first Tuesday of the month? They'll still be there.

## 2. They Fund the Services You Rely On

Property taxes make up about 30% of all state and local revenue—that's over $600 billion each year. Those dollars pay for schools, maintain roads, and keep public safety funded. If those dollars went away, counties would have no choice but to replace them with something else. And that replacement would almost certainly still involve enforcing payment through liens and deed sales.

## 3. Aspirational Promises Don't Change the System

Political leaders often share bold ideas to inspire people. But the mechanics of property taxes are deeply rooted in local government finance. Even if the discussion continues at the national level, the reality is that tax systems and auctions are managed at the county level. Your investing opportunities remain grounded in that fact.

## 4. The Math Doesn't Add Up for Elimination

Regardless of politics, eliminating property taxes outright would mean asking someone else—likely the federal government—to replace billions in annual revenue. That kind of shift simply isn't realistic today. As an investor, that means stability: tax sales are here to stay because counties depend on them.

## 5. What This Means for Your Investment Strategy

Instead of wondering whether property taxes will vanish, focus on what's already in front of you. Every year, thousands of properties go unpaid, counties pursue collection, and auctions happen. Those auctions are where your opportunities are.

The more you understand your county's process—how redemption works, how deed sales are scheduled, and where to pull delinquent lists—the more you can take advantage while others are distracted by national headlines.

## Bottom Line for You

* Property taxes aren't disappearing.
* That means tax deed and lien sales will remain a reliable source of opportunity.
* Your edge comes from doing the research at the county level while others speculate about big-picture politics.

## Quick Action Step

Take 15 minutes this week to visit your county treasurer's website. Look up the most recent delinquent property list, and note the next auction date. The list you pull today could become the deal that changes your investment portfolio tomorrow.
