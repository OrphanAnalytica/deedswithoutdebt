## Can AI Really Help You Buy Properties for Pennies on the Dollar?

*Breaking down the promises, risks, and realities of AI-driven tax deed investing.*

I came across an article this week that made me stop and think. It's about a new program called Tax Deeds AI from Tax Lien Wealth Builders — they're launching nationwide workshops to teach investors how to use their tool to find and analyze tax sale properties faster.

Here's the article if you want to read it yourself: [Business Insider Coverage](https://www.businessinsider.com).

The idea is simple: instead of digging through messy county websites for hours, the tool scans property data across counties and flags potential opportunities in minutes. Pair that with workshops and coaching, and suddenly tax deed investing feels more accessible than ever.

On paper, it sounds like a dream. But you know me — after 12 years in this business, I've learned there are always two sides to the story.

## Why Tools Like This Look Promising

* **Time saver.** Reviewing 100+ properties before a sale? Normally takes a week. With a system like this, it could take a day.
* **Confidence boost.** New investors get a step-by-step approach instead of drowning in courthouse jargon.
* **Broader reach.** Instead of focusing on just one county, tools like this let you scan multiple counties across a state.
* **Better analysis.** Clean, organized data helps spot risks and values faster.

## The Flip Side of "Smart" Tools

* **They're not free.** Access comes with a cost, and it adds up if you're not landing deals.
* **Garbage in, garbage out.** If county records are wrong or incomplete, the tool is wrong too. IRS liens, state tax liens, mechanical liens, and probate issues can still sneak through.
* **Over reliance.** It's tempting to think the tool does the hard work for you. It doesn't. Nothing replaces boots-on-the-ground due diligence.
* **Counties aren't as advanced as you think.** A few big counties have digitized systems, but the vast majority still run on outdated tech. Many still keep records on microfiche or paper files that require you to show up in person. No tool can scan a filing cabinet in a dusty county basement.
* **Local quirks.** I've seen counties in New Mexico and North Carolina handle deeds in ways no national system can fully account for.

## My Honest Take

Look, I think Tax Deeds AI is a sign of where this industry is headed — faster research, cleaner data, more tools at our fingertips. And I'm not against it. But I'd treat it like power steering: it makes the drive easier, but you're still the one behind the wheel.

If I were starting fresh today, I'd:

1. Test a tool like this in one county I know well.
2. Cross-check results with my own assessor and clerk research.
3. Use it as a filter, not a decision-maker.

## Final Thought

Tech is exciting, and workshops like these will draw attention. But the reality is this: most counties across America are still old-school, and until every record is digitized, nothing replaces being in the courthouse yourself.

That's why the smartest investors use a mix — modern tools to save time and traditional methods to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.

At the end of the day, courthouse investing still comes down to the same thing it always has: **knowing more than the person bidding next to you.**
