## Why I'm Writing About This Today

Recently, I've been having a few back-and-forths on Reddit with folks curious about tax sales. What stood out to me? Almost everyone was more interested in deed sales than liens. It makes sense — deeds mean you're buying the property itself, not just the debt.

So I figured it was time to share something useful for everyone asking: Which states actually sell tax deeds?

## Tax Deeds vs. Tax Liens — A Quick Refresher

When someone doesn't pay property taxes, the county has to recover that money.

* **In lien states**, they sell a tax lien — basically an IOU secured by the property. Investors collect interest when the taxes are repaid.
* **In deed states**, they sell the tax deed — which means you're bidding directly on ownership of the property itself.

Lien states give you interest. Deed states give you the property. Big difference.

## The Tax Deed Advantage

Here's why investors like me (and my team) lean toward deed states:

* **Immediate ownership** – Win the auction, pay the back taxes, and the deed is yours.
* **High upside potential** – Properties valued at $100k+ can sometimes start at just a few thousand dollars.
* **No multi-year wait** – Unlike liens, most deed states don't have long redemption periods.

But don't mistake speed for safety. Mortgages, IRS liens, state liens, and title issues don't vanish just because you hold the deed. Due diligence is survival in this business.

## Which States Sell Tax Deeds?

Here's the current list of states where counties sell deeds instead of liens (or a redeemable version of them):

* Alaska
* Arkansas
* California
* Connecticut (redeemable)
* Delaware (redeemable)
* Georgia (redeemable)
* Hawaii (redeemable)
* Idaho
* Kansas
* Louisiana (redeemable)
* Maine
* Michigan (redeemable)
* Minnesota (redeemable)
* Nevada (mixed system)
* New Hampshire (redeemable)
* New Mexico
* New York
* North Carolina (judicial deed with upset-bid system)
* Ohio (mixed system)
* Oregon
* Pennsylvania
* South Carolina
* Tennessee (redeemable)
* Texas (redeemable hybrid)
* Utah
* Vermont
* Virginia
* Washington
* Wisconsin

*(Note: Some are redeemable deed states or hybrids, meaning owners still have a short window to redeem even after the deed is sold.)*

## Why This Matters for You

If you're serious about tax sales, this list is your starting map. It determines your entire playbook:

* In **lien states**, you're mostly after interest income — like a fixed-income investment.
* In **deed states**, you're after ownership — which means bigger rewards, but also bigger risks.
* In **redeemable deed or hybrid states**, you have to factor in short redemption periods or upset-bid processes before you truly own the property.

I cut my teeth in New Mexico, a deed state. The wins were life-changing, but I also saw deals go sideways fast when investors skipped their homework.

## Final Thought

Think of lien states vs. deed states as two different sports. Both can make you money, but the rules and the risks are completely different.

If you know the map before you step into the game, you're already ahead of 90% of people who just "show up" at auctions.

I'd love to hear from you: are there any specific deed states you want me to break down in detail? Hit reply and let me know.
